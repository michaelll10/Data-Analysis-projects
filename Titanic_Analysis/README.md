# Titanic Survival Analysis

This is a simple data analysis project on the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## 📌 What I Did

- Combined train and test datasets
- Handled missing values (Age, Fare, Embarked)
- Created new features like `FamilySize` and `HasCabin`
- Explored correlations and survival patterns
- Visualized key insights using bar plots, box plots, pie charts, and scatter plots

## 📊 Key Insights

- Women and 1st class passengers had higher survival rates
- Higher fare passengers were more likely to survive
- Passengers with cabins listed had better chances of survival
- Family size affects survival — very large families had lower chances

## 📁 Files

- `titanic_eda.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with all code and visualizations
- `train.csv` / `test.csv` – Data files from Kaggle

## ▶️ How to Run
